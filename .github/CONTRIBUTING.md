# Contributing to Agent OS

Thanks for considering a contribution! Agent OS is free and open source, but to keep things manageable we follow a **Discussions-first workflow**.

---

## Where things go

- **Discussions (Bugs):** Report suspected bugs. Maintainers may promote confirmed bugs into Issues.
  ðŸ‘‰ **Check the docs before posting:** [buildermethods.com/agent-os](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os)

- **Discussions (Ideas):** Share feature ideas and proposals.
  ðŸ‘‰ **Check the docs first** to ensure itâ€™s not already supported.

- **Discussions (Q&A):** Ask & answer community questions.

- **Builder Methods Pro:** Paid membership with guaranteed support responses â†’ https://buildermethods.com/pro

## Pull Requests (read first!)

To avoid wasted effort and to protect maintainer time:

- **Bug-fix PRs:**
  Please include `[bug fix]` in your PR title and clearly describe the steps to reproduce and test the fix.

- **Feature PRs:**
  > ðŸ’¡ **Ideas welcome!** We strongly recommend starting with a Discussion in our **Ideas** section to gather feedback and community support before submitting a PR. This helps us understand your use case and explore the best approach together.
  > Please note: New features are rarely accepted into core as we must consider long-term roadmap, maintainability, and support implications. A declined PR doesn't mean "never"â€”it means "not now." Starting with a Discussion gives your idea the best chance of success.

- **Docs-only PRs:**
  Typos, clarifications, and doc improvements are always welcomed.

## How to propose a new feature or integration

Open a Discussion in **Ideas** with:
- Problem & motivation
- Proposed change & alternatives
- User experience impact
- Updating & compatibility considerations

If a maintainer labels it **`approved`**, then a PR may be opened.
